# Merge Two Sorted Lists

## 1/15/25

I understood the algorithm to get to a solution, though I did get stuck on iterating over our sorted LL.
I knew that if I only utilized the sorted head and next pointer that I would essentially be overwriting
the next pointer over and over again. I ended up looking at the solution to see how I iterated over the
sorted LL and it was as simple as just creating another iteration variable for it.

I think what's confusing about LL's is that we manually have to keep track of the iteration and I
always seem to lose the idea that LL's are connected like links/chains, so it would make sense
for an iteration variable to be had when dealing with multiple LL's, since connecting to one to another
LL would result in you 'linking' the chain. Other than that, not bad - I think I'm getting the hang
of basic LL questions.
