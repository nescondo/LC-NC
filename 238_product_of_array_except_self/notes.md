# Product of Array Except Self

## 2/2/26

First time doing this problem in C++. Trying a new method to get exposed to problems as efficiently as possible.
Went ahead and read the problem, understood it, and then the solution to recreate it. From my understanding,
the most optimal solution would be O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity. Essentially,
we would want to create a vector consisting of n number of 1s. Then, we iterate through the values left
of the current index and input those values into our vector. Then, we do the same but for the values to the
right of the current index. Still don't quite understand it but will revisit.

~15min.
