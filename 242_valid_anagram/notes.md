# Valid Anagram

## 1/17/25

Second time completing this problem after roughly over a week. Pretty easy - I think I'm definitely getting
the hang of frequency based questions with maps. First, I thought of implementing it with sorting
but I kind of already knew that wasn't the most efficient solution which was O(nlogn * mlogn).
I honestly forgot the iterator method names, so I just went to solving it via frequency mapping which is O(n). 
This took me about ~2min. Afterwards, I reviewed the solution to get the syntax for sorting iterators 
and implemented it myself.

15min.
