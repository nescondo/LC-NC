# Valid Anagram

## 1/17/26

Second time completing this problem after roughly over a week. Pretty easy - I think I'm definitely getting
the hang of frequency based questions with maps. First, I thought of implementing it with sorting
but I kind of already knew that wasn't the most efficient solution which was O(nlogn * mlogn).
I honestly forgot the iterator method names, so I just went to solving it via frequency mapping which is O(n). 
This took me about ~2min. Afterwards, I reviewed the solution to get the syntax for sorting iterators 
and implemented it myself.

15min.

Did my daily problem a bit late so I chose this. Was able to figure it out pretty easily as it's my third time
doing it. I think I pretty much solidified the frequency algorithm idea with anagram type problems.

~10min.

Fourth time doing this problem. Pretty much recognize the frequency within an array type problems easily now.
Part of the 3 easy and 1 medium problem for NC 150.

~3min.

Pretty easy, used a map to track the frequency of characters in both strings and checked if they matched
one another.

3min.
