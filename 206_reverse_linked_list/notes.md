# Reverse Linked List

## 1/13/26

Second time reviewing this problem. I had the right idea, but need to be a bit more careful on
tracking the iterating variable. With a few hints, I was able to get the most efficient solution at O(n).
My issues stemmed from setting our temp variable to be the current node, which led to some confusion.
In the future, I should just make it easy on myself and whenever I have a temp variable meant
for iteration, to just immediately set it to the next element/node.
